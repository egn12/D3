## Basic D3 Visualizations

Here I'm just learning some D3 by modifying basic visualizations available on blocks:

1. **Interactive bar graph**: with (1) hover (2) window resize and (3) count + frequency; builds on the following [example](http://bl.ocks.org/Caged/6476579)

2. **Scatterplot (*in progress*)**:  builds on the following [example](http://bl.ocks.org/weiglemc/6185069)

3. **Dendogram (*in progress*)**: builds on the following [example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4339083)
